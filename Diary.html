        Dear Diary,<br> 
        I am running late since many months now, I need to hurry up a bit now because its now or never.
        <span class="select">It seems I have become lazy again, </span>  is it because I still don't have the <em>strive to grow and learn new something everyday</em> 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many incidents where i feel I am not giving enough efforts and that sucks even if i am practicing everyday,
        the things are changing everyday even if we do or not so its better to become more conscious or else I will too become my worst nighmare <span class="select">Living life for show but dieing inside truth to be told.</span>&nbsp;<em>Life is lovely gift one should never take it for granted</em> or else you will also regret like everyone else in this world which I do not want at any cost.
    </p>
